    title: Daniel's Journey
    content: |
      Keen On Driving was established by Daniel Keenan at the beginning of 2026. Having previously trained to be a history teacher, Daniel soon discovered that his main motivation was with one-to-one teaching within the moving classroom of being a driving instructor.

      Daniel began his journey to become a driving instructor in 2022 and received his training from Linda Edwards at Express Driver Training, alongside the mentorship of Andy Scanlon of Scan School of Motoring. Without their help none of this would have been possible!

    title: Training & Mentorship
    content: |
      Linda Edwards has a wealth of experience in teaching potential driving instructors and uses a mixture of teaching techniques including observations of her pupils' lessons, one-to-one classroom sessions, group classroom sessions and in-car training. She ensured that Daniel not only passed his ADI Part 3 but also acquired the skills necessary to understand why he passed. It is this deeper understanding that motivates Daniel every day to get the best out of his pupils.

      Whilst training, Daniel was mentored by Andy Scanlon from Scan School of Motoring. Andy, after a successful career in swimming coaching, followed in his dad's footsteps to become a driving instructor and guided Daniel through everything he needed to know. With only around 30% of instructors passing the final test nationally, it was challenging at times, but Andy always found a way to keep Daniel motivated. These are experiences Daniel now passes on to his pupils to give them every chance of success.

    left_content: |
      With Scan School of Motoring, Daniel gained experience teaching a wide variety of pupils:

      - **Confident drivers** who are raring to go
      - **Nervous pupils** who sometimes need gently persuading to sit in the driver's seat for the first time
      - Pupils with **severe anxiety**
      - Pupils with **ADHD**
      - Pupils with **autism**

      Daniel is happy to take each lesson at a pace suited to each individual pupil.

      Daniel understands that all pupils learn differently.

      The more confident drivers can be more likely to take risks, whereas less confident drivers can at times create risks from driving too slow.

      Daniel likes to think that once his pupils are test ready, they have all met at that middle point — below over-confidence but with enough self-belief in their ability.
