    title: About Your Instructor
    content: >-
      Daniel Keenan established Keen On Driving at the beginning of 2026. Having
      previously trained to be a history teacher, Daniel discovered that his
      main motivation was with one-to-one teaching within the moving classroom
      of being a driving instructor.


      He has experience teaching a wide variety of pupils, from the most
      confident who are raring to go, to nervous pupils who sometimes need
      gently persuading to sit in the driver's seat for the first time.
